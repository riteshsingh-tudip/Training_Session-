Set the view port because pages are optimized for variety of devices so it must include a meta viewport 
elememnt inside the head tag.
viewport tells the browser that how to control browsers page dimension and scaling.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

Name is the name for viewport.
Include width=device-width to match the screen's width in device-independent pixels.
Include initial-scale=1 to establish a 1:1 relationship between CSS pixels and device-independent pixels.

Some browsers will keep the page's width constant while rotating or zooming rather than fiiling the screen,
thus adding the attribute initial-scale=1 instructs the browser to eastablish 1:1 realtionship between CSS 
pixels and device-independent pixels regardless of device orientation,thus allows the page to take advantage
of full landscape width.

inital-scale can be replaced with the followings.

minimum-scale
maximum-scale
user-scalable

these may disable the user's ability to zoom the viewport,causing accessibility issue.
